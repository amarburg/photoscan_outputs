# photoscan_outputs

A simple gem to load and parse the various output files which are generate
by the [Photoscan](http://www.agisoft.ru/products/photoscan/)
reconstruction/photogrammetry software from
[Agisoft.](http://www.agisoft.ru)

Please note I am currently testing against Photoscan Professional
version 0.9.0.1586.

At present the Gem only parses the camera XML files generated by "Export
-> Cameras" (sorry, it's all I need at this point).  I'm happy to merge
in support for the other export (and import) file formats.
